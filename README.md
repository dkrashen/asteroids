# HTML5 Asteroids

This game was created Doug McInnes. His code can be found
[here](https://github.com/dmcinnes/HTML5-Asteroids), and you can play his
version of the game online at his website
[here](http://dougmcinnes.com/2010/05/12/html-5-asteroids/).

This repository contains some modifications of (modifications of the code
by Caroline Buckey and Sarah Spikes) by Danny Krashen. The modifications made
by Caroline Buckey and Sarah Spikes were done as a part of the Udacity course.
I've played with the resulting code just a little to create some variations of
the game as branches from their code. An excert from their readme is below:

> Caroline Buckey and Sarah Spikes modified the repository to create exercises for
> the Udacity course [Version Control Using Git and Github](TODO). These
> modifications included introducing bugs and other changes into Dougâ€™s commits he
> did not in fact create! The bugs are intended to give learners experience using
> Git to find the commit where a bug was introduced. To play the modified version
> of the game, simply open the index.html file in your web browser.
> 
> Many thanks to Doug for creating this awesome game.""
